Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Parallel Computing using MPI: A Comparative Study with Serial Computing And Parallel Computing

The challenge of efficiently solving the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem in distributed computing systems, focusing on reducing communication overhead and enhancing algorithm performance. The existing algorithm âˆ†-stepping, it introduces redundant computations when using the aggregation technique, particularly in dense graph scenarios, which can impact its efficiency.

A comparative study between parallel and serial (or sequential) computing involves analyzing the performance and characteristics of algorithms or applications when executed in parallel and serial modes.
Consider a scenario where a fleet of autonomous delivery drones is tasked with delivering packages to various destinations in a city. To ensure efficient and timely deliveries, the drones need to compute the shortest path. 
Our research  can  help to optimize the communication and computation among the drones, especially when they are part of a distributed computing system
It could help reduce message exchanges and redundant computations, enabling the drones to quickly compute and update their routes, thus improving the overall efficiency of the delivery system.
